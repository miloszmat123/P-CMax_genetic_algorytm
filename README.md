# P||CMax_genetic_algorytm
Solution of P-CMax problem using genetic algorythm



# How to run the program
- clone the repository
- run `main.py`  with 2 parameters
    - first 
        - `genetic` if you want to use genetic algorythm
        - `greedy` if you want to use greedy algorythm
    - second - file path
- example `python main.py genetic ./data./m50n1000.txt`

# How to choose data 
You can choose ready data from `data` folder or use the data generator


# What is the P||CMax problem in computer science
In the P || Cmax problem, the task is to arrange ùëõ tasks on ùëö processors in such a way that the completion time of all tasks on all processors is as short as possible.


# What is a genetic algorithm?
In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
